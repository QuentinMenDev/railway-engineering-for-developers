As paths are packed tighter, a small delay to one train blocks the next, which blocks the next — a cascade effect. Research shows that pushing utilisation above ~75% causes reliability to collapse disproportionately, similar to how network throughput degrades as bandwidth saturation approaches.' },

Capacity analysis identifies these chokepoints because adding trains elsewhere is pointless if the bottleneck cannot handle them.' },

Line capacity in trains per hour is approximately 60/headway-in-minutes. Reducing headway from 3 to 2 minutes increases theoretical capacity from 20 to 30 trains per hour — which is why signalling upgrades (like ETCS with moving block) are capacity interventions.' },

It is analogous to post-incident root-cause analysis in software reliability engineering.' },

Too little recovery time makes the timetable fragile (any perturbation cascades); too much wastes capacity and extends journey times. Balancing resilience against efficiency is a core timetabling trade-off.' },
